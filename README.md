# RockPaperScissorsProject

RPS project with UI - finished draft

All images created on Stable Diffusion using the following prompts:

Rock prompt:

"Generate a cartoon-style logo of a rock in shades of gray. The rock should have a playful, yet sturdy appearance, with visible texture and cracks. It should be depicted in a dynamic pose, as if it's ready for adventure. Incorporate slight shadows to add depth, and ensure the overall design exudes a sense of reliability and strength. Avoid intricate details and keep the style simple and iconic, suitable for various applications such as branding or signage."

Paper prompt: 

"Create a cartoon-style logo featuring a sheet of paper in varying shades of gray. The paper should appear crisp and clean, with subtle creases to convey its texture. Depict the paper slightly curved or folded to add dimension and personality. Incorporate a playful element, perhaps with a corner lifted or a pencil resting nearby, to suggest creativity and possibility. Keep the design simple and easily recognizable, suitable for use across different media platforms."
